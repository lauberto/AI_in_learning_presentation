Abstract
The CAT&kittens project is being developed to assist users who want to perfect their skills in
academic Russian writing. The platform is aimed at comparing student texts (“kittens”) against a big
corpus of academic texts (CAT).
One of the future goals is developing an AI-supported algorithm, which allows for detecting and
substituting erroneous collocations, for example, powerful coffee, instead of strong coffee. The
main ideas beyond this service are, first, detecting incorrect collocations in a student text, and
second, creating a list of substitutes, which are semantically similar, yet statistically correct. The
goals are achieved using distributional semantic models, like word2vec, GLoVe, ELMo, BERT, and
GPT models. Distributional semantic modeling allows for creating multidimensional vectorial spaces,
where every word is assigned a vector in a semantic space. Using the vectorial representations one
can retrieve collocations, which are similar in meaning — to the detected erroneous collocations.
